## Context
The aim is to design a web application that would make sharing of bills between individulas in a household easy. This means that 
a user would easily keep track of how bills are being paid in a household instead of worrying about if they have to sit down
and decide what bills need to be paid evey month they would have an automated way of achieving this task.
## These are the coding conventions we chose to follow
1. Every function has a comment at the top
2. For every line of code there should be a line comment unless unnecessary
3. Variable names should start with small letters and if it is made up of 2 or more words, the second word start with a capital letter
4. Functions names starts with a Capital letter and when there are two or more, the second one starts with a capital letter
5. Global constant variables should be in caps
6. Use of indentation for everything within curly braces
7. Use curly braces
8. Use functions for instructions that thoes the same thing to avoid repititions
9. Use white spaces to improve the readability of the code (before and after operators/commas)
12. Separation of concerns using different files
